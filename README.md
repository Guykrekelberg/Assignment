## Python assignment
The repository for the Python Assignment can be found here: 
https://github.com/Guykrekelberg/Assignment.

Plotly and Internal links work only when you download the entire repository.
The 'Python assignment.ipynb' file is the assignment.
The data for the plotly graph can be found in the 'marketshareoudnieuw.csv' file.

Therefore we recommend to download these two files and run it yourself in jupyter notebook!
